/*
 *  The user may provide a buffer into which the undecorated declaration
 *  is to be placed, in which case, the length field must be specified.
 *  The length is the maximum number of characters (including the terminating
 *  NULL character) which may be written into the user buffer.
 *
 *  If the output buffer is NULL, the length field is ignored, and the
 *  undecorator will allocate a buffer exactly large enough to hold the
 *  resulting declaration.  It is the users responsibility to deallocate
 *  this buffer.
 *
 *  The user may also supply the allocator and deallocator functions if
 *  they wish.  If they do, then all heap actions performed by the routine
 *  will use the provided heap functions.
 *
 *  If the allocator address is NULL, then the routine will default to using
 *  the standard allocator and deallocator functions, 'malloc' and 'free'.
 *
 *  If an error occurs internally, then the routine will return NULL.  If
 *  it was successful, it will return the buffer address provided by the
 *  user, or the address of the buffer allocated on their behalf, if they
 *  specified a NULL buffer address.
 *
 *  If a given name does not have a valid undecoration, the original name
 *  is returned in the output buffer.
 *
 *  Fine selection of a number of undecorator attributes is possible, by
 *  specifying flags (bit-fields) to disable the production of parts of the
 *  complete declaration.  The flags may be OR'ed together to select multiple
 *  disabling of selected fields.  The fields and flags are as follows :-
